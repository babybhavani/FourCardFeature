### What I learned

- CSS Grid Templatesâœ¨
    - As a begiinner, I've learnt about the basic alignment of grid templates. In addition with I've grabbbed the knowledge in things like dense properties for rows and columns.
- Grid column templates
  - Used to divide the container into vertical parts
- Grid template rows
  - used to divide the bix into horizontal parts
- Grid items alignmentðŸ¤ž
    - As a designer it is neccessary to learnt about the alignments of the grid Items.
  - Learned about
      - grid-column
      - grid-row
      - grid-area
      - justify-content
      - align-items
      - justify-self
- Items sizingðŸ’Ž
  - It is important to make the grid layout appearance beautifulâœ¨.
  - minmax()-used to set the carad or inner items to a minimum length and maximum length.
  - fitcontent() used to fit the content.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

  <section class="container">
      <section class="headings-container">
        <h1 class="top-heading">Reliable, efficient delivery</h1>
        <h1 class="middle-bold-heading"> Powered by Technology </h1>
        <h3  class="bottom-heading"> Our Artificial Intelligence powered tools use millions of project data points
          to ensure that your project is successful
        </h3>
      </section>
        <section class="card card1">
          <h1 class="card-heading">Supervisor</h1>
          <p class="card-bio"> Monitors activity to identify project roadblocks </p>
          <img src="images\icon-supervisor.svg" alt="supervisior" class="card-img">
        </section>
        <section class="card card2">
          <h1 class="card-heading"> Team Builder
          </h1>
          <p class="card-bio"> Scans our talent network to create the optimal team for your project</p>

        <section class="card card3">

          </p>
          <img src="images\icon-calculator.svg" alt="Caluculator" class="card-img">
        </section>

    </section>
  
```
```css
.container {
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 98%);
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(5, 1fr);
    gap: calc(1rem + 1vw);
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

```

### Continued development
It can be developed with the corresponding html pages linked to it. I am willing to add that features to my project.

### Useful resources

- [CSS GRID](https://cssgrid.io/) - This helped me for alignment of grid items reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Grids in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
